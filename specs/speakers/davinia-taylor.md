## Bio
Davinia Taylor is a biohacking pioneer, double Sunday Times No. 1 best-selling author, and founder of WillPowders. Her health journey began after struggling with weight, ultra-processed food addiction, and low self-esteem. Through biohacking, she transformed her lifestyle and now helps others do the same.

Her approach emphasizes cutting out inflammatory ingredients like sugar and processed foods, adopting intermittent fasting, and focusing on fresh food and good fats. With over a million Instagram followers, Davinia has helped hundreds of thousands of people move away from harmful ultra-processed foods.

Her mission is to empower people to take control of their health, challenging mainstream nutritional messaging through nutrient-dense eating, hormonal balance, and reducing brain fog and toxins.
